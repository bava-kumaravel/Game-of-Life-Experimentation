# Game-of-Life-Experimentation
An initial experimentation with Conway's Game of Life using Unity and C# scripting

Managing to create a simple simulation of Conway's Game of Life in Unity using C# scripting, customized seeds are introduced as Bitmap images into the grid to study their influence on the voxels and the behaviour is documented and analyzed.
